I've created a new blog with Github Pages and Jekyll, based on the [Pixyll theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).
I'll try some things that I come across when researching web development techniques or working on some of my projects.
The focus will probably be PHP and [Laravel](http://www.laravel.com) in particular.

I hope you will enjoy it! If you like what you read, don't hesistate to drop me a message on Twitter :)
